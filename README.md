# ApartRent

The increase of students coming to Groningen and other cities brings up difficulties regarding housing. The issues are 
getting so pressing that some foreign students have even had to sleep in tents due to lack of available rooms and the 
difficulty of finding one. We think it should be easier for owners of rooms and tenants to connect, which is why we have 
developed a platform where room owners and tenants can easily get in touch.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing
purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. As of now, these instructions are only 
applicable for the use of MAMP.

### Prerequisites

* MAMP version 4.1 (Windows) or version 5.2 (MacOS)

### Installing

Place `ddwt18_final.sql` in the `DDWT18_final` folder. Place the `DDWT18_final` folder and in `MAMP/htdocs`.

## Deployment

In PHPMyAdmin create a user with username 'ddwt18', hostname 'localhost' and password 'ddwt18' that has access to the 
`ddwt18_final.sql` file.

In MAMP, start Apache and MySQL servers. In your browser, go to `localhost/DDWT18_final/`. You should now be on the 
homepage.
